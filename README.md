## About Me

I'm a passionate developer focused on building innovative solutions and exploring cutting-edge technologies. Currently enrolled in a computer science mentorship program with Cisco professionals, where I'm learning to create monetizable projects, process subscriptions, and analyze profitability. I focus on passion-driven work with strategic business guidance.

## Automation Philosophy

If I have to do something more than once, I'll probably automate it. There's something satisfying about turning a boring, repetitive task into a script that just works. Plus, it means I can focus on the fun stuff instead of doing the same thing over and over again.

> *"Why spend 6 minutes doing something when you can spend 6 hours trying to automate it?"*
